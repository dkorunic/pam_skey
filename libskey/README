Warning:
========

Many programs in this kit replace system utilities.  Don't replace
system utilities unless you are an experienced system programmer and
system administrator.

I am using these programs daily on SunOS 4 and SunOS 5 systems, so I am
pretty confident that they work well in these environments. 

Other plaforms that are supported to some extent: Ultrix 4, IRIX 5,
HP-UX 9 and OSF 1 (Digital UNIX).  However, I do not have root access
on such systems so I unable to verify that the programs are really
compatible with the ones that they replace.

Introduction:  
=============

This archive contains the result of years of gradual transformations on
BSD source.  All code works with SunOS 4, SunOS 5 (Solaris), Ultrix 4.x
and other BSD43/SYSV4 clones. In addition, the S/Key-ified parts work
with IRIX 5.3, HP-UX 9.0, and Sony NewsOS 4.x; the login clone also
reportedly works with Linux. There is a very good chance everything
now also works with Digital UNIX, but I was unable to test this myself.

(1) rsh and rlogin daemons that log the remote username and perform
    logging and access control in tcp/ip wrapper style.  By default
    these daemons do not accept wildcards in hosts.equiv or .rhosts
    files. Both daemons have an '-l' option to disable user .rhosts
    files. The rshd optionally logs the user command (edit Makefile).
    The programs are more picky than usual about file permissions
    of .rhosts files:  they must be owned by the user (or by the
    superuser), and they may not be group or world writable.

(2) ftpd, rexecd and login software with fascist login failure logging
    and with optional support for S/Key one-time passwords.  The rexecd
    daemon disallows root logins, once my favourite backdoor.  The
    support for S/Key one-time passwords is optional, and completely
    invisible to users that do not need it.  UNIX passwords are still
    permitted by default. A short description of how to use S/Key can
    be found in the skey subdirectory. Binaries for DOS and other
    systems can be found on thumper.bellcore.com. The rexecd optionally
    logs the user command (edit Makefile).

(2a) ftpd and login software that supports the SecureNet card (code
    donated by William LeFebvre, Argonne National Laboratory). This
    software needs a DES library (for example, host ftp.psy.uq.oz.au
    directory /pub/Crypto/DES). See snk/README for more information.
    The code has been tested with SunOS 4.x and 5.x.

(3) an S/Key login shell for sites that cannot replace the login
    program. Users first log into a password-less dummy account. The
    S/Key login shell prompts for their real account name and presents
    the corresponding S/Key challenge.

The S/Key support uses the MD4 or MD5 hash function. The mode (MD4 by
default, for backwards compatibility) is selected in skey/Makefile.

The rshd and rlogind programs need the libwrap.a library that comes
with recent (version >= 7.0) tcp/ip daemon wrapper implementations.  In
order to build rshd and rlogind you will have to do a

	setenv LOG_TCP /directory/with/libwrap.a

Contents per directory:  
=======================

rlogind logging and access control in tcp wrapper style.  Regular
	access is logged (by default) with priority daemon.info.
	Rejected access is logged with daemon.warn or more urgent.
	SunOS 4.x, SunOS 5.x and Ultrix 4.x. In order to use the "-l"
	(ignore user .rhosts files) option you will also need to
	install the login clone (see below). 

rshd    logging and access control in tcp wrapper style.  Regular
	access is logged (by default) with priority daemon.info.
	Logging of commands is a compile-time option (see the
	rshd/Makefile).  Rejected access is logged with daemon.warn or
	more urgent.  SunOS 4.x, SunOS 5.x and Ultrix 4.x. 

login   hacked for SunOS 4.x, SunOS 5.x, with optional access control
	per (user,host) or per (user, tty); fbtab(5) security; fascist
	login failure logging.  Regular logins are logged with priority
	auth.info, unusual or rejected logins with auth.notice. S/Key
	support. Can also be used with Ultrix 4.x for logins on
	non-graphics consoles. Appears to work with IRIX 5.3, HP-UX 9.0
	and Linux (Slackware), NewsOS 4.x, Digital UNIX.

rexecd  Regular access is logged with priority daemon.info.  Fascist
	login failure logging.  Logging of commands is a compile-time
	option (see rexecd/Makefile). Rejected access is logged with
	auth.warn or more urgent. Access to the root account is
	prohibited.  S/Key support. SunOS 4.x, SunOS 5.x and IRIX 5.3.
	Should also work with Ultrix. May work with HP-UX 9.0 and
	NewsOS 4.x, Digital UNIX.

ftpd    ftp daemon with fascist logging and login failure detection
	much like the login clone. Also logs anonymous ftp transfers.
	Tested with SunOS [45].  S/Key support. Should also work with
	Ultrix 4.x. May work with IRIX 5.3, HP-UX 9.0, NewsOS 4.x,
	Digital UNIX.

telnetd pretty dumb BSD 4.3 telnetd. No access control or logging,
	but compatible with SunOS 4.x, Ultrix 4.x, SunOS 5.x.
	Relatively poor in features (no environment passing) so there
	is less risks of surprises.

keysu   NET/2 BSD su command ported back to SunOS 4.x, with S/Key
	support. Tested with FreeBSD and SunOS 4.1.3. May work with
	IRIX 5.3, HP-UX 9.0, NewsOS 4.x, Digital UNIX.

skeysh  An S/key login shell for sites that cannot replace the login
	program. The solution is to create a dummy account with skeysh
	as the login shell. skeysh is nothing but a stripped-down
	skey-only login program.  People first log into the dummy
	account. This drops them into skeysh that prompts them for
	their real account name and presents the corresponding S/Key
	challenge.  Tested with SunOS 4.1.3 and with Solaris 2.3 and
	IRIX 5.3.  Should work anywhere the login clone works.

lib     additional routines used by login and by some daemons.
	Includes the ruserok() function that understands NIS, NFS
	(yuck) and that optionally skips user .rhosts files, and
	functions that mangle various UTMP file formats.

skey    Portions of S/Key source from thumper.bellcore.com, plus code
	that I hacked together myself. All bugs are my own. Edit the
	Makefile to choose between the MD4 or MD5 secure hash function.
	MD4 is default, for backwards compatibility.

snk     Code for the SecureNet card by William LeFebvre, Argonne
	National Laboratory). See snk/README for more information.

Change log:  
===========

19901218 Fixed a problem with NOFLSH in login.c that caused interrupts
	to not flush the terminal input queue.

19910209 Added per-user login access control.

19911128 Added support to login for SunOS 4.x style /etc/fbtab, a table
	of devices whose protection and ownership is to be adjusted
	when a user logs in.

19920609 Added tcp wrapper (log_tcp) style access control to rlogind and
	rshd. Improved the remote host name verification code. Added
	the LD_xxx environment fix to login.

19920624 Login no longer just dies when the connection is broken, but
	first reports a login failure. This exposes an old cracker's
	trick.

19921029 Ported to Ultrix 4.2. Most of the work was finding out why the
	login process did not have a controlling terminal.

19921208 Ported to Solaris 2.0. rlogind can now work with the /bin/login
	that comes with most UNIXes. This was desirable because not
	everyone is in a position to replace /bin/login.  Moreover,
	some SYSV logins can't even support the '-f' option at all (or
	everyone could login without a password). 

	2alpha version released.

19921229 Tested with Solaris 2.1; some cleanups after looking at
	modified 4.4BSD sources from Charles Hedrick
	(hedrick@cs.rutgers.edu).  The sources can be found on
	farside.rutgers.edu.

19930103 Most of the sensible SYSV login features implemented. Frozen
	after check, check and double check. The source really suffered
	from porting and has become too ugly. It becomes a lot more
	readable after running through the unifdef program. 

	Version 2beta released.

19930119 Version 2 released after compatibility patches: rshd path;
	disabling the local domain stripping in login.c; cleanup utmpx
	file after rejecting an rlogin connection.

19930221 Added group support to the login access control code, so that
	we can disallow off-site logins to wheel group members.  Group
	matches work only for accounts that are explicitly listed in
	the group file: the matching is not based on group id values.

19930222 Stole the code for the EXCEPT operator from the tcp wrapper.
	This, and the previous change, allows me to replace:

		# Disallow non-local logins into the wheel accounts
		+:foo bar baz:LOCAL .my.domain -:foo bar baz:ALL

	into the much easier to understand:

		-:wheel:ALL EXCEPT LOCAL .my.domain

	Assuming, of course, that the default is to permit access.

19930331 Added per-program hints on how to configure syslogd.
	Added __svr4__ to the Solaris CFLAGS macro because the
	unbundled C compiler does not define it.

19930925 Upped the number of ptys that telnetd and rlogind will attempt
	to open.  The original versions would give up after 64 ptys.

19930925 rshd now preserves TZ info when running under SunOS 5.
	We were too compatible with SunOS 5.

19930925 login will now syslog() all regular logins, too. It took
	me too much time to examine individual wtmp files.

19930929 Ultrix last minute patch to fix rshd environment handling. The
	fix must be ok for SunOS too but no time to verify this.

19931206 With SunOS 5.x, Do not pass the "-p" option to login.

19931212 Added logindevperm support for compatibility with SunOS 5.3.

19931212 Added support to the login command for secure (DES) RPC (only
	for SunOS [45].x). This requires that the cleartext password be
	kept around until we have dropped privileges.  Had to jump some
	hoops to prevent the program from ever dropping core with a
	cleartext password.

19931212 Print error message when the login.access file exists but
	cannot be opened.

19931225 Added S/Key support to login 'cause I was going on a trip.

19931229 While on my trip, added S/Key support to ftpd.

19940106 Woke up at 5am and realized there was a problem in my S/Key
	stuff.

19940107 S/Key Solaris portability fixes from Douglas Lee Schales.

19940110 Make sure that keyinit does not produce world-writable files.

19940112 SysV4.0 wtmpx portability fixes from Baruch Cochavy.

19940124 Fixed some ftpd  and skey things that broke for Ultrix 4.x.

19940125 Fix for Solaris uname(2) >0 return value. I fixed this before
	but somehow the change got misplaced. From Douglas Lee
	Schales.

19940130 Made initial seed from skeyinit.c more random (use seconds
	instead of minutes). I managed to produce the same seed on
	multiple machines. The whole seed generation procedure sucks
	anyway:  taking the first two letters of a host name.

19940205 Made initial seed from skeyinit.c more random (use last 5
	digits of current time in seconds).

19940206 Fixed some login Makefile things that broke for Ultrix 4.x.

19940206 Had some real fun with (argh) NIS+. The old BSD login code
	would blindly close all filedescriptors > 2 right AFTER it had
	processed the command-line options. I had to move the closing
	of open files right to the top of the main program. The reason
	for this is that all kinds of nisplus library routines secretly
	open sockets or files and keep them open forever. They get very
	upset when you unexpectedly close their open files.

19940306 Finally got so disgusted from the BSD/SYSV #ifdefs that I
	began to clean up the login program. From now on we use POSIX
	instead of BSD/SYSV ifdefs.  Many of my personal enhancements
	are no longer conditional. Ultrix misses some definitions so
	login won't compile there anymore.

	Kerberos code for login.c (John DiMarco
	<jdd@cdf.toronto.edu>).

19940312 Security feature: when S/Key decides whether UNIX passwords are
	ok, skip IP addresses listed for the remote host that appear to
	belong to someone else.

	Cleaned up the rlogind/telnetd code (POSIX interfaces instead
	of BSD/SYSV ifdefs).

	Changed the ftpd S/Key password prompt so that the MS-DOS
	`termkey' TSR can parse it.

19940314 Cleaned up the ftpd code (POSIX interfaces instead of BSD/SYSV
	ifdefs).  Ultrix misses some definitions so ftpd won't compile
	there anymore.

	All code now compiles and works on freebsd, which has become my
	development platform while traveling.

	The code compiles OK on an Indy running IRIX 5.something:  just
	pretend to be sunos5.

19940317 The telnetd/login programs no longer assume 7 or 8 bits, but
	leave CS7/CS8 tty settings alone.

19940321 Modern rloginds seem to prefer 8-bit clean settings, so we
	force CS8 from now on.

19940326 Our system administrator wanted netgroup support in the login
	access control file. This took only a few lines of code. A
	netgroup is written as @name, and can be used in host patterns
	and in user patterns.

	Included the keyinfo command and documentation, after getting
	rid of localisms.

	keyinit now restores the tty settings when it is interrupted.

	logdaemon-4.1.tar.Z released.

19940426 Backwards compatibility code for Ultrix in login and ftpd.

	Added keysu (s/key su) command. This has little to do with
	daemon stuff but it just makes the package complete. This has
	been tested only with SunOS 4.x and FreeBSD.

	Unset FLUSHO in login.c, in case it helps.

19940430 rexecd and rlogind now use the fd_set macros, to shut up
	the ANSI C compiler.

	converted net/2 su.1 man page to old -man macro style.

	William C. DenBesten asked for user@host patterns in the login
	access control files, so he could control many machines with
	just one set of rules. Fortunately, this took only a few lines
	of code.  The hostpart is matched against the local host name.
	With user@host patterns and netgroups you can build impressive
	patterns such as @usergroup@@hostgroup.

19940505 Peter Kossakowski (dfn cert) mentioned he usefulness of the -l
	option to ignore user .rhosts files. On most systems, the
	ruserok() library function have no support for that, so a
	modified version is provided.

	As a bonus, '+' wildcards are by default no longer accepted.
	Instead a loud complaint is sent to the syslogd. The programs
	must be compiled without -DNOPLUS to re-enable '+' wildcards.

	The -l option is supported by rshd, rlogind and by the login
	program (rlogind must pass on the -l option when the login
	program does the hosts.equiv/rhosts processing).  Thus, in
	order to use -l you will have to replace both rlogind and login
	(and, of course, rshd).

	Most path names and syslog logging classes are now configurable
	from the Makefile.

19940516 Fixed the README and released version 4.2.

19940523 Just like the login program, the ftpd now tries to avoid
	dumping core with cleartext or encrypted (shadow) passwords.

19940628 Generalized the format of the /etc/skey.access file so you can
	permit/deny UNIX passwords depending on user, tty and/or host.
	There is a new manual page, skey/skey.access.5 that documents
	this new format.

19940718 Fixed another thing that broke with Ultrix: in lib/rcmd.c
	moved an #endif up to above the rresvport() routine.

	Now that you can specify what terminals are secure, the S/Key
	code has been modified to always permit UNIX passwords on the
	console. This saves you the embarrasment of having to break
	into your own machine. Alas, on some systems the console is not
	called /dev/console.

	Released version 4.3.

19940908 Added -user and -host support to ruserok().  No-one complained
	sofar, but most systems document it. Looks like one feature
	that Berkeley dropped.

	HP-UX and BSDI support from Howard Chu for login, keysu and
	s/key.

	Replaced Howard's "vendor" #ifdefs by "feature" #ifdefs.

	(s/key) When built with -DSECURETTY, the keysu command will not
	accept the root password unless it is invoked from a secure
	terminal.  Idea from Howard Chu.

	(s/key) "keyinit -s" would ask for counts up to 10000 but the
	actual limit is 9999 (Howard Chu).

	(s/key) Eliminated a possible localhost vs localhost.domain
	clash (Howard Chu).

19940910 Collected system dependencies in one central file (sys_defs.h)
	and cleaned up the Makefiles. This may help when porting to
	other systems.

19940911 After discussions with Guido van Rooij, documented several host
	name and address spoofing loopholes that may cause S/Key to
	permit UNIX passwords to unauthorized clients.

940914/5 Porting rexecd, ftpd, rlogind and telnetd to HP-UX 9.0 was not
	impossibly difficult. The effort may be useful to someone.

19940917 Disabled the `site' extensions (umask, chmod) for ftp guest
	logins.

19940922 Replaced the MD4 code by the byte-order independent versions
	from the NRL distribution on thumper.bellcore.com. MD4 is still
	the default. Edit skey/Makefile to switch to MD5.

19941001 Idea from *Hobbit*: sites that cannot replace their login
	program create a dummy s/key account with as login shell a very
	much stripped-down skey-only login program.  The skeysh program
	is my result of such an exercise.

19941002 Cleaned up docs and comments.

	Released version 4.4.

19941014 setenv() was missing an argument in skeysh/skeysh.c. This
	should not cause problems, but gcc barfs on it. sigh.

19941022 Fixed pointer indirection level in lib/utmp_login.c. This
	would produce unpredictable results for HP-UX.

19941105 Parametrized some hard-coded lengths for environment variables
	and fixed some rather short limits on username length.

19941121 Changed the default console from /dev/console to none. This is
	more compatible with SysV (Kevin Davidson).

19941121 Dropped ptyopen() etc. support for HP-UX. Having to support
	BSD and SYSV ptys is bad enough.

19941126 It seems that assignments of static data to the environ
	variable may cause trouble on non-BSD systems. Instead of

		environ = envinit; execl(...);

	we no longer replace environ but truncate it and use putenv():

		environ[0] = 0; putenv(...);

19941127 On System V all daemons now preserve the complete initial
	environment. There were several reports of missing TZ values.
	I was unable to reproduce them with Solaris 2.3 and gcc.

19941127 Fixed skey/skeylogin.c to look at more than just the first 8
	characters of the login name.

19941127 Fixed something in the skeysh/Makefile that broke on Ultrix.

	Released version 4.5.

19941129 With Solaris 2.x, keysu would recognize '-' as a user name.
	This is due to getopt() incompatibilities. Fix: SysV su does
	not support options anyway, so drop the getopt loop.  Reported
	by in1052@wlv.ac.uk (A.Parkes).

19941129 Found another static assignment to environ in keysu.c.

19941130 Should have used setenv() to set the user's path in keysu.
	Reported by Patrick Cipiere <Patrick.Cipiere@sophia.inria.fr>.

19941209 With passive open, do not wait forever in accept(). Idea from
	casper@fwi.uva.nl in article <3asnqc$1h0@mail.fwi.uva.nl>.

19941218 Changed rlogind and rshd to use the open-ended tcp wrapper 7.0
	programmatic interface, so that banners can be used.

19950101 Patches from David Mazieres: close redundant file descriptors
	in rshd and rexecd; workaround for broken HPUX setsid(); also,
	the HP-UX baud-rate codes differ from those on other
	platforms.

19950101 Ftpd would send bare linefeeds when listing files over an
	ASCII-mode data connection, causing problems with wattcp
	clients (reported by Shou-Chuan Lai).

19950108 Released 4.6, together with TCP wrappers 7.0.

19950111 David Mazieres: HPUX cc is pickier than I expected. What's
	worse, they already define a struct request_info. Time for a
	horrible workaround.

19950111 In S/Key passwords, accept commas instead of blanks, to work
	around stupid software that collapses blanks in passwords.

19950121 Added SYSV shadow support to keysu (suggestion: Leif
	Hedstrom).

19950213 skeyaccess could dereference a null pointer when host lookup
	failed (Larry J. Blunk @ Merit.edu). How embarrassing.

19950222 Make ftpd try again when the data port bind() fails with
	EADDRINUSE.

19950222 keysu did not strip the "/dev/" from the device name when
	looking for a secure terminal (Rob Liebschutz).

	Released 4.7.

19950229 Oops. The securetty code in keysu looked at the wrong tty
	variable (Matthew Needes).

19950308 Some Solaris applications may pass a '-' as username to
	/usr/bin/login (Kadlecsik Jozsi).

19950321 Protected all environ[0]=0 assignments by a test if environ is
	nonzero. Ultrix daemons may have a null environment pointer,
	how bizarre. Paul Sijben helped me figure out this one.

19950414 Oops. do_access() should call exit() not cleanup() (credits to
	Shou-Chuan Lai of National Tsing Hua University).

19950422 Completed ULIMIT, UMASK and SLEEPTIME login default support.

19950423 IRIX 5.3 support for s/key utilities and login/ftpd/rexecd.
	I still need to figure out what some IRIX login options do.

	Released 4.8.

19950425 The login kerberos code had stopped working (David Mazieres).

19950426 HPUX login now sets LOGNAME environment variable.

19950428 Start of yet another series of S/Key code cleanups (Guido van
	Rooij, Tom Dunigan, some thrown in myself).

19950429 Linux (Slackware) login fixes (Michael Brennen).

19950430 IRIX problem: libnsl breaks NIS lookups (Tom Dunigan).

19950430 IRIX now takes default user and root PATH from <paths.h>.

19950430 More Linux (Slackware) login fixes (Michael Brennen).

19950430 IRIX login now also sets REMOTEUSER.

19950430 Folded in support for Sony NEWS-OS V4 (Jun-ichiro Itoh).

19950430 Makefile cleanups: recursive make -n, intel outside.

19950430 FreeBSD 2.0 workarounds (sys_errlist) so I can work on this
	code on my laptop while in the train.

19950430 Made console device name configurable via sys_defs.h so that
	skeyaccess does the right thing with Linux.

19950501 With HPUX, now use the system's getusershell() routines and
	don't link in the SYSV default routines when building skeysh.

19950501 Implemented IRIX login default MAXTRYS (login attempt limit).

	Released 4.9. This release was expedited because of a file
	descriptor leak in my own S/Key glue routines. The leak could
	give logged-in users write access to s/key control files.

19950502 The keyprint script (to print credit cards with s/key
	passwords) did not set PATH (Lionel Cons).

19950622 FreeBSD needs linking with -lcrypt or you get a weaker crypt()
	algorithm. Now I can hack logdaemon while on the train.

19950805 On systems with shadow passwords, rshd should not look at
	password fields from /etc/passwd (Peter A. Bigot).

19950806 Ultrix login now displays the LAT port (Michael A. Crowley).

19950807 Workaround for variadic functions on the alpha and other
	architectures where sizeof(int) < sizeof(pointer). Should
	change the code to use varargs/stdarg instead.

19950812 Folded in the support for SecureNet keycards from William
	LeFebvre, Argonne National Laboratory. Presently, this is
	tested for SunOS 4/5 only, but probably works on everything
	else.

19950812 Added my best guess for OSF1 (now Digital UNIX) system
	dependencies: late BSD-ish with SYSV utmp.

19950812 The rexecd and rshd servers will log now user commands when
	compiled with -DLOG_COMMANDS (see Makefile).

19950813 ftpd now closes unused passive ports, and rejects PORT requests
	that specify a privileged port or a third-party host (Hobbit).

19950814 Removed unnecessary seteuid() calls in FTPD passive mode.

19950815 FTPD Passive mode can now be forced to bind to ports in a
	specific window by doing, before make:

	    setenv PASV_WINDOW "-DPASV_MIN_PORT=nn -DPASV_MAX_PORT=mm"

19950826 With secure RPC, the user's password should be truncated to 8
	characters (Kjell Hogstrom).

19950930 Skeysh did not re-enable INT and QUIT signals (Jay
	Borkenhagen).

19951001 Changed the skeyaccess() interface. The skey.access "group"
	now also matches the primary group ID. (Michael Aichlmayr).

19951001 Code reorganization: system dependencies moved from Makefile
	to sys_defs.h, common files moved to lib directory.

19951012 Removed a redundant ulimit() call in login.c and skeysh.c: it
	broke with a zero ulimit in /etc/default/login (Carson
	Gaspar).

19951017 Skeysh now preserves the REMOTEUSER environment variable.

19951020 Updated the ftpd manual page to reflect today's reality.

19951021 Some HP-UX tty drivers still default to the @ and # line
	editing characters, and rely on the login program to sanitize
	them (Gordon Marler).  The login program now fixes such ancient
	settings.

19951021 Avoid potential problems by saving results from functions with
	volatile results such as inet_ntoa() and gethostby*().  With
	Solaris library routines doing their own hidden connection
	management, such library results become unreliable.

19951024 Dropped some redundant code and declarations from rexecd.

19951024 The rshd host name spoofing test was slightly broken.  The
	program would dump core instead of logging the attack.  I
	wonder how many treasures of this kind still lie buried in the
	BSD source code.

19951024 ftpd now uses facility LOG_AUTH, just like rexec and login.

19951024 While in the underseas tunnel between France and the UK,
	fixed an obscure s/key ftpd core dump that happens when the
	user sends no password.

19951027 Updated the fixenv() environment stripper.

19951028 System dependencies now trigger on hpux9 instead of hpux,
	so that we can more easily migrate to HP-UX 10.

19951028 Added support for window size changes to the telnet daemon.
	This is about the only essential feature that I was missing.
	In the process fixed a bug in the telnet suboptions handling.

	Released 5.0

19951029 The S/Key routines now syslog an error when they are unable to
	open the skeykeys file. Better be explicit than have people
	wonder why something did not work.

19951030 Cleaned up the ftpd yacc grammar. The YACC stack is now a union
	so it no longer assigns pointer values to integers.

19951124 Solaris 2.5 now needs _SVID_GETTOD (Frank Kaefer) or we have
	a function prototype conflict.

19951201 In transfer logs, ftpd should not log the current directory
	when the remote user specifies an absolute path name.

19951201 login_access() did not match primary groups (Dave Adamson).

19960115 Work around for HPUX 9.x in case the client hostname is unknown
	(telnetd/rlogind pass the *server* address on the command line).

19960115 In the Makefiles, osf1 changed to decosf1 to avoid confusion
	with OSF on Intel.

19960115 Several DECOSF patches from Lawrence MacIntyre.

19960115 keysu now logs the host from which the user is logged in
	(Marcus Schwartz).

19960115 Now also logs file owner and permissions problems with .rhosts
	files instead of just refusing to use the file (Bob Beck).

19960115 keysu now has the '-c command' option.

19960115 Cleaned up some logging code in login (Chris Metcalf).

19960213 Better HP-UX 9.x compatibility (Eric Backus).

19960213 No "wheel" group restriction for "su root" for SYSV systems
	(except SunOS 5...).

19960213 Ignore empty "wheel" groups (Chris Metcalf).

19960226 Christophe Dorchies found an missing argument in a
	fatalperror() call in the rlogind program.

19960308 UTMP fix for Digital-UNIX - it's not really a SYSV-UTMP system.

19960308 Jean-Luc Szpyrka spotted an unitialized memory read in btoe().

19960314 SunOS 4 sets the LOGNAME environment variable, and so should
	we (Peter W. Osel @ Siemens).

19960322 rlogind/rshd did not pass server name/address info to the tcpd
	library routines (Shou-Chuan Lai <chuan@cs.nthu.edu.tw>).

	Released 5.1

19960425 Made skeyaccess() robust against null user arguments
	(Cedomir Igaly ).

19960518 keysu did not chek the return from getenv("TERM") (Henry Ptasinski)

19960518 snk_crypt() left secrets behind in memory (Henry Ptasinski).

	Released 5.2

19960616 Patches for the login program for Digital UNIX with enhanced
	security (Cedomir Igaly). Specify -DDECOSF1_ENHANCED to enable
	this and link with -lsecurity (see login/Makefile).

19960616 Use the Digital UNIX utmp/wtmp routines instead of our own
	(Cedomir Igaly, Lawrence Macintyre).

	Released 5.3

19960920 Removed redundant waitpid() declaration from ftpd/popen.c.
	It caused a prototype conflict.

19961013 William LeFebvre: fix of 960518 caused SIGSEGVs due to a
	missing initialization.

19961016 How stupid of me. Marc Binderberger found a missing ntohs()
	call that caused ftpd to erratically reject client PORT
	requests.

	Just in case, PASV and PORT commands now require that the user
	is logged in before they can be used.

19961029 Andrey A. Chernov: [in skey_getpass.c] Change "nope" to ":".

19961031 rlogind no longer changes the VMIN and VTIME fields.

	Released 5.4

19961123 Reportedly, some resolvers (Solaris) do not protect
	applications against unreasonable h_length values from the
	network.  Protected the skey and snk code against such
	nonsense.  This protection was delayed because I moved from
	Europe to the USA for a sabattical year.

19961123 Copied some patches from skey/skeyaccess.c to snk/snkaccess.c.

19961222 In BoS, Joe Zbiciak spotted a buffer overflow in login.c main()
	that dates all the way back to almost 10 years ago. It is
	not certain that this can be exploited (main() never returns)
	but it shouldn't be there anyway.

	Released 5.5

19970104 David Greenman of the FreeBSD project found an interesting
	problem in wuftpd that allows remote users to access files
	as root.  The same hole was also present in the logdaemon
	ftpd, and probably in many other ftpd implementations, too.
	The fix is to disable signals while ftpd temporarily raises
	its privilege level or while it does other critical stuff.

	Released 5.6

19970111 When not guest, do seteuid(user) before chdir(~user) to avoid
	problems with permissions over NFS (Doug Hughes).

19970222 Limited the amount of text used when syslogging a hostname
	from the DNS.

19970729 In ftpd, now suspend signal delivery instead of dropping 
	unwelcome signals.

19970729 Workaround for wrong ftp-log xfer times on systems where
	<sys/stat.h> st_size is larger than long.

19980420 In ftp xfer stats, print ? when the current directory is unknown.

19980901 Use makeutx() in order to support more than 255 ptys.

19990830 More string length paranoia.

	rshd now enters the home directory after changing privileges
	(Peter W. Osel @ hl.siemens.de).

	login now reports login failures after read timeout (Jim
	Hranicky @ cise.ufl.edu).

	login now supports "passwd -f" password expiration (John
	R. Vanderpool @ gsfc.nasa.gov).

	keyinit would dump core when given a bad argument (Jim
	Simmons @ Oak Ridge National Labs).

	"ftpd -d" would log passwords from non-anonymous sessions
	(Mark Bergman @ phri.nyu.edu).

	DEC OSF 1 patches from Lawrence MacIntyre, Oak Ridge National
	Labs.

	keysu syslogging is now more consistent with other tools
	(Jim Simmons @ Oak Ridge National Labs).

	Released 5.7

19991107

	Port to RedHat 5.0 LINUX. We'll see how soon it breaks again.

19991108

	Port to RedHat 6.1 LINUX. Will they ever stop screwing up their
	include files?

20000104

	Y2k: the ftp server's MDTM command was broke.

20000105

	Missing { in ftpd.c

	Released 5.8

20010203

	ftpd popen() could run over the end of an array. This is
	not your /bin/sh buffer overflow but it is wrong anyway.

	Released 5.9

20010319

	Lame DOS fix to disallow globbing characters before the
	final slash in file globbing patterns.

	Released 5.10

20010416

	Shortened the maximal result length from glob() to avoid
	a buffer overflow problem in the retrieve() routine.  Fixed
	null pointer bugs when glob() returns an error. Shortened
	the command FTP parser's input string length in order to
	prevent buffer overflows due to combinations of wild-card
	expansion and directory walking.

	Released 5.11
