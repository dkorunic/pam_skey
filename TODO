TODO/worklist:
(NOTICE: not necessarily in "right" order)

* detect and use NetBSD SKey library

  Seems like FreeBSD and NetBSD libskey is completely compatibile with
  Venema's logdaemon/skey since those two are derivatives from latter.

* abandon logdaemon SKey support

  Nope. Perhaps add support for Linux-SKey library?

* add md4/sha1/md5 support

  MD4/5 can be done through Makefile for logdaemon..

* add support for Linux-SKey library

* add support for SecureID

* drink a good cup of coffe

* get married
