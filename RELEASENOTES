RELEASE 1.1.0 - Wed Mar  7 20:27:23 CET 2001

This release addresses several seen problems:
1) Problems with original logdaemon package:
file skeylogin.c
function int skeyinfo()
<...>
  case 1:   /* User not found */
  fclose(mp->keyfile);
  return -1;                     <-------- obvious wrong return value
<..>

2) In Solaris 2.7 I have noticed peculiar behavior: with PAM_ECHO_ON,
pam_conv puts '\n' at the end of received string. This fixes that problem,
too.

3) Fixed annoying compiler warnings under Linux
