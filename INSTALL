Required
--------
For building this package you will need original Wietse Venema's logdaemon
package. You should unpack it and make `libskey.a' (library containing
some of the functions we are using) and other required utilities
(`keyinfo', `keyprint', `skeyaccess', `key', `keyinit') as you would
normally do.

Configuring and making
----------------------
Next step should be running `configure' script, that will try to determine
parameters of your system. Use `--with-skey-inc=PATH_TO_SKEY_INCLUDES' and
`--with-skey-lib=PATH_TO_SKEY_LIBRARY' to specify where to find valid
S/Key installation, if it is not in standard paths. For example:

  ./configure --prefix=/usr/local --with-skey-inc=../logdaemon-5.8/skey \
    --with-skey-lib=../logdaemon-5.8/skey

It will test various aspects of include files, libraries, library calls,
and trace potential problems. It should leave valid Makefile afterwards
for make.

Installation
------------
If you did not specified standard prefix with `--prefix=PATH', default
installation path will be `/usr/lib/security'. There should reside
`pam_skey.so.1' and `pam_skey_access.so.1', as well as symlinks for them
ending in `.so' suffix.

Configuring
-----------
If you did all this successfully, now it is time for you to setup your
local PAM configuration files. They can be either pam.conf either
pam.d/<service>, depending on PAM implementation. I am including examples
of standard PAM modules stacking. For detailed module options check
chapter `Options'.

pam.conf:
  su  auth  sufficient pam_skey.so.1
  su  auth  required   pam_unix.so.1  use_first_pass

pam.d/su:
  auth  requisite   pam_securetty.so
  auth  requisite   pam_nologin.so
  auth  required    pam_env.so
  auth  sufficient  pam_skey.so
  auth  required    pam_unix.so       use_first_pass

For more detailed description, check local pam manpages.

Options
-------
This module understands following options that can be specified in pam
configuration files:
  debug                 - Turns on debugging output through syslog() calls
  echo=off              - Turns off PAM_ECHO, service will not show passwd
                          on screen when typing
  echo=on               - Inverse of the above option
  access_check=on       - Checks S/Key access through skeyaccess() call,
                          it will check keyaccess file
  access_check=off      - Obviously, inverse of the above option
  use_first_pass        - Helpful for stacking PAM modules, it will try to
                          use passwd string from previous module if it
                          possible
  try_first_pass        - Alias for the above
  only_one_try          - It allows only one password try per PAM session
